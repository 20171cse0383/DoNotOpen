<em>In classical physics and general chemistry, matter is any substance that has mass and takes up space by having volume.
</em><br>
<q> All everyday objects that can be touched are ultimately composed of atoms, </q> <br>
<mark>which are made up of interacting subatomic particles, and in everyday as well as scientific usage, </mark><br>
<strong>"matter" generally includes atoms and anything made up of them,</strong> 
<address>and any particles (or combination of particles) that act as if they have both rest mass and volume.</address>
